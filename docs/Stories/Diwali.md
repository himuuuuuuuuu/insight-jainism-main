### End Notes

- Lord Mahavira is the last Tirthankar of this era.  Since uncountable years, Jainism used to be there in existence and infinite souls attained salvation by following the true path.

- Though, all the scriptures, knowledge, texts etc. that are available today are the preachings by Lord Mahavira. In the Samavsaran, the Gandhardeva passes that knowledge to Saints and Saints spread the knowledge to their disciples and in turn available in form of Scriptures.

- The Jainism texts, scriptures etc. that are presently available are indirectly the preaching of Lord Mahavira and we are indebted for it.

- Apart from preaching **"Ahimsa"**, Lord Mahavira taught us that every living organism in the Universe is having capabiity to become God like him and to see everyone with equality - as Souls.

- God is neither the creator of the Universe nor the Controller of the Universe. God is a pure and true "state" of the Soul free from Karmas and that is what Lord Mahavira taught us.  So, How can we beg about our worldly fickle happiness like health, money, fame etc. in front of the ONE who preached us NOT to run after them?

- This is what Bhagwaan Mahavir has taught us. Let us follow the path he has shown us; and attain the state of Siddha soonest.

"**भूतकाल प्रभु आपका, वह मेरा वर्तमान। वर्तमान जो आपका, वह भविष्य मम जान॥**"

> O Lord Mahavir! The past of yours, is today; my present. And I will thrive to make my future, your present.
