## Chapter 1

### Neeti 1

> It is not that only a person who drinks the all "Amrit" becomes happy; But even a man who drinks a little "Amrit" becomes happy.

**Explanation**: In this world, it is not necessary that one drinking more Amrit can only become happy. But if one drinks Amrit according to one's capability and strength, then also one can become happy.

In similar way, it is not that a very descriptive and detailed biography will be fruitful, but even if it is explained in crisp manner, then also it will be equally fruitful. 

And thus, Acharyadev tells that he will write this scripture in brief manner.
