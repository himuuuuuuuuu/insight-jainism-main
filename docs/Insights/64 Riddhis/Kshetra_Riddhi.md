1. **Akshinmahansik Riddhi**

It is the miraculous power by which the food left in the Bhojanshala (where prepared food is placed) after the great Jain Saint possessing this Riddhi has completed Aahar-charya; even if it is consumed by the whole cantonment (army camp) of the Chakravarti King; never decreases even a bit in its quantity! And thus, it becomes enough for everyone to be satisfy their hunger with it! 

The limited food quantity in limited area of Bhojanshala becomes enormously vast in its quantity; enough to serve these many people! This shows the greatness of the Saints possessing this Riddhi to transform the area!

2. **Akshinmahalay Riddhi**

It is the miraculous power by which the great Jain Saint can make uncountable number of humans and animals fit inside a small region of 24 x 24 Feet square area (4 Dhanush x 4 Dhanush square area)!

**Isn't this amazing?**
