1. **Jal Chaaran Riddhi**

It is the special power of the soul by which the great Jain Saints can travel on water like that of traveling on land (walking on water); without touching the water and not causing any harm to any **Jalkaayik Jeev** (living organisms who has the body of water). By saying not even Jalkaayik Jeev are harmed; it is implied that no organisms (of 2 to 5 senses) living inside water are harmed!
