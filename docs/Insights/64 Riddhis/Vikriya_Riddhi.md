:::tip Aren't these powers amazing?

We all have heard about these Riddhis in some or the other form as supernatural powers in Superhero or Sci-fi movies (Like Antman making body small or Invisibility Cloak in Harry Potter or Ghosts traveling through the walls!) Knowing such great Riddhis being possessed by the saints; does the superhero powers excite you anymore? No, right?

Yes, agreed! These powers are amazing. But does these powers matter anything to the great Jain Saints who possess these?

Not actually! How can one who has experienced the happiness and bliss on the inside can ever be surprised by some external powers on the outside? In fact, the external powers like these are also attained by taking the refuge of the inside! 

But what makes these Riddhis special is that they are the fruit of the soul's great austerity. Only the saints penancing in the forest, on leaving all the materialistic belongings and aspirations aside; just taking shelter of their own soul with the aim to attain true bliss and salvation are able to develop such Riddhis. 

Not just that, the Saints who possess this Riddhi, many times don't even know that these external powers exist within them! Why? Because, they are so involved into the Dhyaan, Tap, etc., that they seldom spare any time to focus on external powers like these. It clearly reflects that this greatness makes them deserving of these special powers; and that is why no human with worldly attachments and materialistic belongings will ever be able to possess these powers!
