From the previous discussion of **Riddhi**, we have clearly understood that Riddhis are miraculous super-natural powers that are attained by great Jain Saints as a result of their extreme austerity. But, we have often heard about super-natural powers possessed by normal humans as well in our Epics!

E.g.

- Lord Hanuman had the power increase and decrease his body size and can fly in air
- Indra possesses powers as equivalent to hundreds of thousands of airavat elephants etc.
- Heavenly beings and Hellish beings can change their body shapes as per their will
- Chakravarti can clone into thousands of same bodies

**What are these powers if not Riddhis?**

They powers are called **Vidyas**. They are possessed by many beings from different factors like their body types, heredity, learning etc. and not from austerity. The humans residing in the cities on the **Vijyardh Mountain** are known as **Vidyadhars** and they possess some special **Vidyas**.

Let us see difference between **Riddhi** and **Vidya**:

| Riddhi | Vidya |
|-------|------|
| By the virtue of extreme austerity, Riddhis are attained without any other dependent factor.      |   Vidya is not attained by itself.   |
|  Only attained by Riddhi-dhari Muniraj     |  Attained by Vidyadhars.    |
|   The Muniraj (Saint) who possesses Riddhi are called 'Rishi'    |  The humans who possess Vidyas are called 'Vidyadhars'    |
| Riddhi-dhari Muniraj are prayed | Vidyadhars are not prayed |
| There is no owner of a Riddhi | There is an owner of a Vidya |
| Having Riddhi is connected to the purity of soul | Having Vidya is not connected to soul's purity|
| Riddhi is attained after attaining Monkhood (becoming a Saint) | If a Vidyadhar wants to become a saint, then they have to renounce their Vidyas as well |
| Riddhis are only attained by Sanyamis (one who has taken Vrat, Niyams etc.) | Vidyas can be attained by Sanyami or Asanyamis both |
| Riddhi has no dependency on family, hereditary, tool etc. | Vidya is dependent on family, heredity or tool to develop it |
| Riddhi is a lot much more powerful than Vidya | Vidya is a lot much weaker than Riddhi |
| There are no rules for Riddhi | There are rules for Vidya |
| Riddhi is not Parigrah (accession) | Vidya is Parigrah (accession) |
