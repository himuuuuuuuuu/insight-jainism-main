### Introduction 

"Ramayana" has been one of the most influential mythological/historical epics ever in the Indian Culture. Not just in Jainism; but it has been an integral part of Hindu and Buddhist literature; and many different versions of it has been in place since ages.

It is very disheartening, disturbing and unfortunate that only less people in today's world know about the Jain version of Ramayana. We are indebted to the great saint [Acharya Ravishen Swami](./../Biographies//Acharyas/Acharya_Ravishen_Swami.md) whose **Padma-puraan** has cleared all our misconceptions, manipulations and false beliefs prevailing in different other versions of Ramayana particularly the popular Hindu scripture "Valmiki Ramayana"; and has depicted the true story of **Bhagwaan Ramchandra**.

In this section, we will be taking a glimpse of important differences between **"Valmiki Ramayana"** and **"Jain Ramayana/Padma Puran"**. This information is carefully referenced directly from the "Padma-puran" by Acharya Ravishen Swami.

### 1. Ravan
- He was a [**Pratinarayana**](./Shalaka%20Purush/Balbhadra_Narayan_PratiNarayan.md) king; the ruler of 3 Khands in Bharat Kshetra.
- He was a Vidyadhar (read about Vidyadhars [here](./64%20Riddhis/Riddhi_vs_Vidya.md)) and not a **Rakshash** (demon). Valmiki Ramayana manifests Ravan to be a Demon/ Evil; but in reality he belonged to a dynasty (vansh) named "Rakshash"! In fact, he was a Vidyadhar King with super-natural powers along with being a Pratinarayan. All [Shalaka Purushs](./Shalaka%20Purush/Introduction.md) are the most influential torchbearers and promoters of Jainism of their time; and thus Ravan was too! This clearly tells that he wasn't a **Shiv-bhakt** according to Valmiki.
- **Ravan kidnapped Sita ji, but didn’t even touch her.** According to **Valmiki Ramayan**; he was given a Shrap (curse) by Vishnu that he’d die if he touched a woman without wish. But according to Jainism, Ravan went to Samavsaran of **Anantvirya Kevali**; and took an oath (Niyam) of not touching any woman without her wish! In spite of him being blind in his senses to kidnap Sita; he wasn't blind enough that he broke his oath that he took in front of Bhagwaan. *In fact, he preferred dying in a war instead of breaking the oath and doing wrong act with Sita ji! This teaches us a lot, doesn't it?*
- Ravan attained a Vidya called **Bahuroopini** (making multi-clones of oneselves) in Bhagwan Shantinath Temple. In other versions of Ramayana it is told that he got powers from Vishnu. But in reality, he could attain powers (Vidyas) because of him being a Vidyadhar human! He didn't have 10 faces, but this Vidya could be the reason of it when he used during the war!
- He was called **Dashanan** not because he had 10 faces. When he was born; his face was reflected in a necklace having 10 jewels; and thus 10 faces were seen; thus the name Dashanan.
-  **Ravan** (Pratinarayan) was killed by his own Sudarshan Chakra (the ruler of 3 Khands have this Chakra) fired by **Lakshman** (Narayan) in the war; with being accompanied by **Shri Ram**(Balbhadra). It is the rule of Universe that in every time cycle -  *Narayan with the help of his elder brother Balbhadra defeats Pratinarayan to become the ruler of 3 Khands*.
-  Ravan went to **3rd Narak** where Sita’s Jeev in form of **Achyut Indra** in Heaven comes to preach Ravan's Jeev about Mokshmarg (Sambodhan); and there he attains **Samyaktva**. These type of details aren’t found in Valmiki Ramanyan!
- He is going to be a Tirthankar in the next Chovisi.

### 2. Mandodari
- The Pat-rani (the chief Queen) of Ravan
- When Ravan was blind in **Abhimaan** and **Kaam** of Sita, Mandodari tried a lot to make Ravan understand his mistake. *‘Vinashkaale Viprit Buddhi’*; and thus Ravan didn’t heed any advice of Mandodari, and died in the war with Lakshman.
- After the death of Ravan, the two son of **Mandodari** - Meghnath and Indrajit both took Diksha. Also, Mandodari along with many women took Aryika Diksha.

### 3. Dashrath
- Dashrath had given his **Queen Kaikai** a promise (var); which she could any time. When kingdom was decided to be given to Ram, Kaikai wanted her son Bharat to be the King; and thus exercised the promise and told Dashrath to make her son **Bharat** the king of Ayodhya. So, Ram, Lakshman and Sita had to go to exile for 14 years! 
- After that, **King Dashrath** takes Jin-diksha. In Valmiki Ramayan, it is shown that Dashrath gets indulged into materialistic and sensual pleasures; which is in a way an insult to such a great king!

### 4. Ramchandra

- When Ravan was doing Siddhi of Bahuroopini Vidya in Bhagwan Shantinath Temple for war; people asked Ram to kill him at that time. Shri Ramchandra denies that act calling it ‘Inferier/Cowardly’ act. 
- There is no reference to Shabari in Jain Ramayana.
- The **Sita-haran story** in Jainism is different to that of Valmiki Ramayan. Eg. there was nothing like ‘Lakshman rekha’! 
- Ram does Ravan’s antim sanskaar; and had no hatred with him.
- Carried his brother Lakshman on his shoulders for 6 months, showing affection for his brother. These information about the what happened after Ramchandra got Ayodhya is scarce in other versions.
- Like Chakravarti has **96000 Queens**, Narayan and Pratinarayan has **16000 Queens**, Shri Ramchandra being a Balbhadra had **8000 Queens**.
- He took Jin-diksha and attained salvation from **Mangi-Tungi Siddha Kshetra**.

### 5. Sita

- Sita ji passed the Agnipariskha where the fire became water; was a mircale performed by heavenly beings out of the respect and admiration of the powerful character of her.
- After that, she took **Aryika Diksha** from **Prithvi Mata ji**. In Hinduism it is believed that she devoted herself and assimilated in the Prithvi (land), which doesn't even sound logically or practically possible.
- Lav and Kush, the two sons of Sita attained salvation from Pavagadh Siddha-kshetra.
- Sita ji's Jeev became **Achyut Indra** in Heaven; from where it goes to preach Ravan in hell. Not just that, she also goes to test Shri Ramchandra's austerity in the forest!

### 6. Lakshman

- He was a **Narayan King**, the younger brother of Shri Ramchandra. 
- He had natural affection for his elder brother (All Narayans have this type of affection for their elder brother Balbhadra)
- In the war with Ravan; he becomes the reason of Ravan's death by Sudarshan Chakra and then becomes **'Narayan'**, the ruler of 3 Khands! This contradicts to the Valmiki Ramayan, where it says that Ramchandra killed Ravan.
- The heavenly beings (Devs) come to test his love for Shri Ram; and tells a lie to Lakshman that Ram has died. Listening this, Lakshman dies of shock!
- He goes in 7th Hell.
- Lakshman's Jeev is going to become Tirthankar in **Dhaatkikhand Dweep** after a few lives!

### 7. Hanuman
- Hanuman was a **Kamdev** (Like there are 24 Tirthankars, there are 24 Kamdevs in each Kaal half-cycle who are most good/attractive looking human on earth)
- He was also a **Vidyadhar King** like Ravan.
- He belonged to **Vaanar Dynasty** (not a monkey). This is very much conflicting with the popular Ramayan where everyone has been misinformed that Hanuman, the Kamdev King was a monkey!  
- Also his father was not Pavan dev (as in Hinduism Pavan-dev is a God). He was the son King Pavan, and thus the name **Pavan-putra Hanuman**.
- His mother Anjana was abandoned by his father Pavan when she was pregnant with having Hanuman in womb; and spent her time in caves and forest.
- When Hanuman was born, he was kidnapped by some Vidyadhar; and when fell on mountain the whole mountain broke. This shows the immense strength he possessed!
- According to Hinduism, he tried eating Sun and the whole story of Surya-dev etc. This sounds very irrational and impractical. Because in Jainism, Hanuman, Ram, Ravan etc. are humans and not God by birth; these type of activities are not true.
- He accompanied Ram to get Sita back from Ravan.
- Also, his brothers and related characters - Sugriv, Sudeep, Neel, Mahaneel etc. were also **Vidyadhar Humans**; and not Monkeys. 
- There is nothing like **‘Vanar Sena**’. Yes, Vanar-vansh sena was be there because they helped Ram and Lakshman for war!
- There is no reference for **Ram-setu** bridge or monkeys writing ‘Ram’s’ name on stones to float. Also many historians claim that Sri-Lanka is the original Lanka where Ravan resided. But this story is after the nirvaan of Tirthankar Munisuvrat; which counts to thousands of years ago! The geography has drastically changed through the time!
- He attained salvation from **Mangi-Tungi Siddha Kshetra**.

### Conclusion

In this way, we have briefly learnt about the differences between Jain Ramayan and other versions of Ramayan. The purpose of knowing these is to be aware about the reality, not fall into any blind-beliefs that are actively being ran in the society; and thus also propagate the true knowledge passed to us from numerous Acharyas and Vidvaans to the world. 

**The ultimate motive is to take lessons from these illustrious characters of the history; and walk through their footsteps on the path of liberation.**
