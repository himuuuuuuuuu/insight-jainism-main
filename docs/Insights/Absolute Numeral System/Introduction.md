In this section, we will be exploring and learning about the `Aloukik Ganit` a.k.a the "Absolute Numeral System" in Jainism.

### What is "Absolute Numeral System"?

**Absolute Numeral System** (referred as **Alaukik Ganit**) is the mathematical number system that has excerpts from the ancient scriptures dated approximately 200 B.C. 

This system has clear definitions, explanations and bifurcations of the **Numerables** (the number system Modern Maths deals with), **Innumerables** and **Infinite**. Yes, in Jainism; the term ***"Infinity"*** is not *Abstract*, but very well defined quantity.

Since **Karnanuyog Jainism Scriptures** explain the Universe, Metaphysics, etc. and the quantities are in the scale of Infinite; this system is very important to be established to explain in great detail.


**"Alaukik Ganit"** is one of the base for reading Karnanuyog scriptures and thus basic understanding is always helpful to grasp it well.

### Introduction

The **Absolute Numeral System** is divided broadly into three types :
1. Numerable (*Sankhyaat*)          
2. Innumerable (*Asankhyaat*)  
3. Infinite (*Anant*)

#### Numerable
The Numbers that can be perceived or understood just by representing with digits or symbols fall under **Numerable** category. They are finite. Numerable starts from 2 as the minimum.

#### Innumerable
The Numbers that cannot be perceived or understood by represented with digits or values are known as **Innumerable numbers**. Thus, different visualization methods, intuitive methods are used to represent them. Though they are extremely large in value, but are finite.

#### Infinite
**Infinite** is that quantity that is unchanged even on performing mathematical operations like addition, subtraction, etc. on it. There are 9 major types of Infinity, and are well defined on how to calculate them.It is not 'Relative' or 'Undefined' term as considered in Modern Mathematics.

### Types of Numerable
**Numerable numbers** are classified in majorly 3 types:
1. Minimum = 2 (*jaghanya*) 
2. Intermediate (*madhyam*)
3. Maximum (*utkrutsht*) (this is the maximum value a normal human can perceive with the help of digits)


### Types of Innumerable numbers

**Innumerable numbers** are classified in majorly 2 types:
1. Value-based (proper calculation methods are used derive and perceive its value) 
2. Intuition-based (intuitive and visualization methods are used to derive and perceive its value)

#### Value-based
Value-based Innumerable numbers are bifurcated further into 3 types (and totalling to 9 types):
1. **Paritasankhyat**
    1. Minimum (*Jaghanya*)
    2. Intermediate (*Madhyam*)
    3. Maximum (*Utkrusht*)
2. **Yukasankhyat**
    1. Minimum (*Jaghanya*)
    2. Intermediate (*Madhyam*)
    3. Maximum (*Utkrusht*)
3. **Asankhatasankhat**
    1. Minimum (*Jaghanya*)
    2. Intermediate (*Madhyam*)
    3. Maximum (*Utkrusht*)

#### Intuition-based
Intuition-based Innumerable numbers are bifurcated further into 3 types (totalling to 8 types):
1. **Palya** and **Saagar**
2. **Suchyangul**, **Pratarangul** and **Ghanangul**
3. **Jagatshreni**, **Jagatpratar** and **Jagatghan**

**Some equations** to compute **Innumerable numbers**:

    1. Min Pariasankhyat = Max Numerable + 1
    2. Min Yukasankhyat = Max Partiasankhyat + 1 
    3. Min Asankhayatsankhayt = Max Yukatasankhat + 1 
    4. (Min Paritasankhat) ^ (Min Paritasankhat) =  Min Yuktasankhyat 
    5. (Min Yuktasankhat) ^ 2 = Min Asankhayatsankhayt

### Types of Infinite numbers
**Infinite numbers** are bifurcated into 3 types (totalling to 9 types).
1. **Paritanant**
    1. Minimum (*Jaghanya*)
    2. Intermediate (*Madhyam*)
    3. Maximum (*Utkrusht*)
2. **Yukanant**
    1. Minimum (*Jaghanya*)
    2. Intermediate (*Madhyam*)
    3. Maximum (*Utkrusht*)
3. **Anantanant**
    1. Minimum (*Jaghanya*)
    2. Intermediate (*Madhyam*)
    3. Maximum (*Utkrusht*)

**Some equations** to compute **Innumerable numbers**:

    1. Min. Paritanant = Max. Asankhayatsankhayt + 1
    2. Min Yukatanant= Max. Paritanant + 1
    3. Min Anantanant = Max Yukatanant+ 1
    4. (Min Paritanant) ^ (Min Paritanant) = Min Yuktanant
    5. (Min Yuktanant) ^ 2 = Min Anantanant

### Some practical examples of these large numbers

- The total maximum number of humans at any time in the Universe is finite and are equal to: **79,228,162,514,264,337,593,543,950,336**
- The total number of Stars in the Universe are finite and are equal to: **2 X 68,975 X 10^14**
- The Max Life span of Humans in 1st ERA is **3 Palya**.
- The Dimensions of the Universe is **14 X 7 X 7 Rajju** (which is an Innumerable Quantity).
- The total number of concentric islands in the Middle Realm(Madhyalok) falls under **Innumerable** category.
- The age of the Universe, the total number of Souls, total number of matter particles is **Infinite** of corresponding type.
- The total number of **Gods (Siddhas)** in **Siddhalya** of the Universe is **Infinite** of its correspondning type.
