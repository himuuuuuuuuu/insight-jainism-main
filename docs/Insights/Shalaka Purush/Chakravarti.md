:::tip ‎
A Chakravarti, if he renounces these worldly pleasures; can become **God** (like Bharat Chakravarti) or go to **heaven**. Alternatively, if a Chakravarti becomes a slave of his senses, wealth, power, belongings etc. goes compulsorily to the **hell**. 

And thus, even Chakravarti; on realizing the fickleness of the materialistic world, to get eternal happiness and bliss; he **renounces** this world leaving all his belongings and moves forward on the path of salvation.
