:::info What is Kaal Chakra?

The Universe is considered as without any beginning or end - Infinite. Thus, the entity **Time** is also Infinite.

The **Cosmic Wheel of Time** signifies that even though Time is Infinite, the Universe is repetitive and repeats itself.

Thus the time is divided into infinite equal **Time Cycles** that keep on repeating infinitely called as **KAAL CHAKRA**

The **Kaal Chakra** is divided into 2 Epochs.

- Avasarpini (Descending in terms of happiness)
- Utsarpini (Ascending in terms of happiness)

Each epoch has 6 Eras (known as Kaal). In the 4th Era, these **63 Shalaka Purush** are born! We are currently in the 5th Era of the time cycle.
