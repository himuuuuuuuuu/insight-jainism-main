The one who establishes **Tirth** (dharma/moksh-marg) are called Tirthankars. They establish and preach the real path of salvation i.e. Mokshmarg to the world. 

Because our purpose is true happiness (that is attained by salvation), **Tirthankaras** are our true ideals to follow.

Tirthankaras have 5 Kalyanaks (Auspicious events). The heavenly beings come on earth to celebrate these auspicious events!

1. **Garbh Kalyanak** (celebrated when the soul of Tirthankar comes in his mother's womb)
2. **Janma Kalyanak** (celebrated when the Tirthankar takes birth as a child)
3. **Tap Kalyanak** (celebrated when the Tirthankar takes Digamber Jain Diksha and renounces all the worldly possessions)
4. **Gyaan Kalyanak** (celebrated when the Tirthankar attains Kevalgyaan i.e. Infinite/Complete Knowledge)
5. **Moksh Kalyanak** (celebrated when the Tirthankar attains Salvation/Nirvaan)

When Tirthankar attains **Kevalgyaan** (infinite knowledge), Samavsaran (sermon) when thousands of souls get opportunity to listen to Tirthankar bhagwaan's Divyadhwani/deshna (teaching).

This knowledge from Samavsaran is today available to us! How? It is by below steps:

- Gandhardev listens to the **Divyadhwani** (preachings) of Tirthankar. 
- Out of that **Gandhardev** processes/gains only infinite part of what he could listen. 
- This knowledge of mokshmarg is passed to **Acharyas** in the Samavsaran. 
- After this, **Shrutkevalis**, numerous **Acharyas**, etc. pass on this invaluable knowledge further. 
- This knowledge is written on **Taadpatras (taad leaves)**. The first ever excerpt of Jainism concepts and moksh-marg in written form is **'Shatkhandagam'** granth written by Acharya Bhutbali and Pushpadanta. 
- With time, that knowledge has flowed like a river from hundreds of Acharyas, Vidvaans etc. to us today in the form of Jinvaani (shastras/scriptures/granths) today!

In this way, whatever Jainism literature is available to us today is actually what Tirthankar Mahavir said in his Samavsaran.
